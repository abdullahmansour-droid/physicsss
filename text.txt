Physics is a natural science concerned with the study of matter, energy, forces, and the interactions between them. It is one of the oldest and most important sciences, aiming to understand the natural laws governing the universe. Through experiments and theories, physics seeks to answer fundamental questions such as how the universe was formed and how natural forces operate.

The basics of physics include concepts such as motion, time, space, and forces. There are multiple branches of physics, including classical physics which studies motion, heat, sound, and electricity, and modern physics which encompasses the study of relativity, quantum mechanics, and nuclear physics.

One of the most important practical applications of physics is in the development of technology. Technologies such as lasers, electronics, and magnetic resonance imaging are based on physical principles. Moreover, physics plays a significant role in the advancement of medicine, engineering, and space sciences.
